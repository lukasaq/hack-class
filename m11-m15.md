#### CDAH-M11L1-PowerShell Fundamentals Review ####

PowerShell Objects
PowerShell is an object-oriented scripting language. 

﻿

The fundamental concept in PowerShell scripting is the object. A PowerShell object is essentially a data structure. This data structure may be composed of data only, or it may contain code for execution. Executable PowerShell objects are known as functions, cmdlets, or modules, and are described in greater detail later in the lesson. 

﻿

Data Objects
﻿

Classes
﻿

PowerShell objects are built on common schemas known as classes. These classes form the blueprint for the instantiation of the objects. Classes define an object’s properties, which are strictly typed fields of data, and methods, which are actions that may be performed on an object. If a particular object is intended to be instantiated many times in many different sessions, then creating and exporting a class as its blueprint is the appropriate design choice.

﻿

Custom Objects
﻿

While everything in a default instance of PowerShell is composed of objects, for some scripts or tools, it is useful to create custom data structures to store the data for a limited duration. For this purpose, an analyst may create custom objects to store and manipulate data for the life of the script or the terminal session. There are a number of techniques to accomplish custom object creation, but in all versions of PowerShell since 3.0, the PSCustomObject type definition is available. Creating a custom object with that syntax is shown below.

$newObject = [PSCustomObject]@{

    Property1        = $output.property1
    Property2        = $secondoutput.property2

}
﻿

Hash Tables
﻿

This syntax demonstrating the creation of a custom object is also an example of the hash table, which is a key-value pair data structure in PowerShell that is useful for a number of commands, queries, and on-the-fly object creation. In a hash table, each set of two elements is relationally joined so that one, the key, directly points to the other, the value. A hash table in PowerShell is created with the following syntax, which employs three examples of value data types.

$newHashTable = @{ key1 = $value1; key2 = "value2"; key3 = 3}
﻿

If not added during instantiation, keys and values may be added to the hash table in one of the following ways:

$hashTable = @{}

$hashTable.Foo = 'Bar'

$hashTable['Foo'] = 'Bar'

$hashTable.Add('Foo','Bar')

Executable Objects
﻿

Functions
﻿

Functions are prepared selections of code that make execution more modular. By envisioning what may be executed, a savvy analyst may prepare all the operations to be performed on a particular object, leaving only key variables to be retrieved at runtime. Functions are either declared dynamically in a script or called from installed PowerShell modules.

﻿

Functions that are declared dynamically consist of one or more statements that dictate a function’s operation. They are formed by combining the function keyword, a descriptive function name, and one or more valid PowerShell commands inside a set of script block braces. 

﻿

A very simple example function looks like the following:

function Custom-Function {
	Write-Output "Hello World"
}
﻿

A function may be further defined in more advanced ways by adding one or more of the following statements.

﻿

Param Statement

﻿

Parameters are a way of introducing user-supplied data to the function. Each parameter Is listed under the param statement block with the typecast [Parameter()] and a type definition such as string, int32, or a named PowerShell class like FileObject:

[CmdletBinding()]
	param(
		[Parameter()]
		[string]$Variable
	)
﻿

Unless the definition of the parameter includes the keyword Mandatory with the code [Parameter(Mandatory)], all parameters defined in this block are considered optional.

﻿

When the function is called, parameters are filled by inserting data after a hyphenated parameter name, such as the following:

Custom-Function -Variable "DATA"
﻿

Parameter variables are also sent to the function from the pipeline by adding the ValueFromPipeline attribute to the parameter definition:

[CmdletBinding()]
	param(
		[Parameter(Mandatory, ValueFromPipeline)]
		[string]$Variable
	)
﻿

The command below becomes a valid method of passing data to the function. This is a memory-sensitive way of performing execution on a sequence of objects if that is a concern. 

@("DATA1", "DATA2", "DATA3") | Custom-Function
﻿

NOTE: In the above example, only the last item is acted upon, unless a process statement is included in the function, which is described below.

﻿

Dynamicparam Statement

﻿

Dynamic parameters are complicated but powerful parameters available to a function if specific conditions are met. These parameter definitions are useful in certain cases where the function is used on a specific provider drive (such as the Registry) or only when a different optional parameter is used, or when another parameter has a specific value, all cases of which are not known until runtime. 

﻿

The syntax for the dynamicparam statement is below.

dynamicparam {
	If (condition) {
		Code
	}
}
﻿

Begin Statement

﻿

If a function is expected to iterate over multiple objects from a pipeline, there may be some one-time setup operations necessary to begin processing data. In this case, the begin statement defines a block of code performing those operations. If the begin or end statement is used, all three code-based statements (begin, process, and end) must be defined, even if they are empty.

﻿

The syntax is simply the begin keyword before a script block wrapped in braces.

	begin {
		Code
	}
﻿

Process Statement

﻿

The process statement defines which activity of the function is performed on every object received through a pipeline. If no pipeline data is ever received, then this statement is unnecessary. However, if that is a valid use case, then it is used to delineate iterative tasks from setup and cleanup tasks. When referring to the current object in the pipeline, the syntax $_ or $PSItem is used.

﻿

The syntax is simply the process keyword before a script block wrapped in braces.

	process {
		Code -object $_
	}
﻿

End Statement

﻿

If a function is expected to iterate over multiple objects from a pipeline, there may be some one-time cleanup operations at the end of the process. In this case, the end statement defines a block of code performing those operations. If the begin or end statement is used, all three code-based statements (begin, process, and end) must be defined, even if they are empty.

﻿

The syntax is simply the end keyword before a script block wrapped in braces.

	end {
		Code
	}
﻿

Cmdlets
﻿

Cmdlets are a subset of functions in that they are named executable objects, but the key distinction from functions declared from scripts or in a session is that cmdlets come built into the PowerShell framework by default and are written in a different language, such as C#, rather than in PowerShell itself. 

﻿

To list all possible cmdlets in a system, the cmdlet Get-Command is extremely helpful. 

Get-Command -Type Cmdlet

Modules


PowerShell module files are denoted with the .psm1 file extension and are loaded into a PowerShell session in the working directory in which the module file is located by using the following command: 
Import-Module <Module-Name>



In a host analyst’s line of work, it is common to become familiar with and rely on the developments of others who have solved the same problems faced by Windows systems defenders and written modules that contain many functionalities useful for a defender, such as the modules DeepBlueCLI (a Windows Event parsing framework), PowerForensics (a hard drive forensics framework), or Kansa (an incident response framework).


Properties


Properties are attributes of a particular PowerShell object. In accordance with the object’s class definition, these properties point to and label data that is relevant to the object. For example, in a PowerShell file object, its properties include the name, size, location, and modification timestamp of the file. Much of this data is actually ported directly from the Windows kernel file object, which is a logical interface to the data on disk. Because the PowerShell framework is written in compatibility with the same framework that forms much of the Windows OS, this access to Windows objects and their translation to PowerShell objects through the underlying framework is common.


For a given PowerShell object, the various properties, subordinate objects, and methods that may be executed on that object are obtained with the cmdlet Get-Member.


For example, executing the Get-Member cmdlet on any directory object, such as a user’s Documents folder, returns the following output.
PS C:\Users\trainee> Get-Item ".\Documents\" | Get-Member



![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c8cd821-f724-4946-be1c-609bbccd9753)



One of the first things to notice is that Get-Member returns the type name of the object, which reveals the class the object is a member of. A number of methods are also returned here, which are pieces of code related to that class and may be executed on objects of that type. 


Alias


It is important to note that many PowerShell cmdlets have an alias that may be used to invoke that cmdlet from a terminal session or even within a script. There is a danger in relying on an alias for invoking a cmdlet, however. There is no guarantee that the environment in which the alias is invoked contains that alias or that it points to the intended cmdlet, even if that alias is normally available by default.


The list of aliases available in a given PowerShell terminal session is retrieved with the command Get-Alias, which is itself aliased with the characters gal.




![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b49292ce-93c3-4189-9fb6-09aeff73c80e)


Pipelines


Pipelines ("|") provide the ability to send output from one command into another for further processing. Examples of commands used with pipelines are Get-Member, Format-List, and Select-String. Figure 11.1-4 provides an example of using Select-String with the Get-Content cmdlet to filter the results.

-----------------------------------------------


PowerShell Data Gathering Cmdlets
In PowerShell scripts and commands, the following cmdlets are useful for gathering data about particular Windows components or systems. A combination can create a comprehensive picture of a Windows system state.

﻿

Get-Item
﻿

This cmdlet returns the object or list of objects from the specified location. This is used to retrieve a directory, a list of files in a directory, a property of an object, a registry key, or any other object that may be specified by a location in a PowerShell drive.

﻿

Get-Item is used to retrieve a registry key and its subkeys using the following syntax:

Get-Item HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Powershell\1\Shellids\Microsoft.Powershell\




![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44813c6c-ba92-4210-a487-4e6906c4c4e1)




Some registry keys of note include the AutoRun keys, which are often used by malicious actors to gain persistence to a machine with each reboot or log in. Those keys are listed below.
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ RunServices
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ RunServicesOnce
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ RunOnce\Setup

Get-Item is also used to retrieve the items in a directory using the following syntax. The wildcard character * specifies all items. 
Get-Item -Path "C:\*"

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1b57065-df23-4fae-9288-8378e0299a23)

Get-ItemProperty


This cmdlet is used to return all the properties of an item. On file objects, this cmdlet operates similarly to Get-Item, but on registry objects, the difference is that while Get-Item returns the key and any subkeys, Get-ItemProperty returns the values of the key.
Get-ItemProperty HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb3b8e19-dcfd-4326-ad5f-8e24157c36ea)

Get-ChildItem


This cmdlet is similar to the Windows command-line command dir, in that it retrieves a directory listing if the object of the command is a file system directory object. It is also used to retrieve all the registry values if the object of the command is a registry key.


This is used to retrieve all the items in a specified directory using the following syntax:
Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\"

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de7168d9-2611-4f83-b4e5-78b3f36fa81c)

When a complete directory listing including not only child items but all subfolders, their children, and further descendant objects is required, Get-ChildItem is called with the -Recurse parameter switch. Setting the -Recurse parameter instructs the cmdlet to perform subdirectory recursion. 


In some cases, an analyst only wants to retrieve certain types of files or filenames. In this use case, the -Include parameter is used to only return entries matching a specific pattern. For example, to only find executable files in the Program Files directory and subdirectories, the following command is used:
PS C:\Program Files> Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Include *.exe

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/baf2e42d-6be2-40c1-8bf2-657cdefc6f8f)

Get-Content


This cmdlet is used to retrieve the data in a file as an array of strings. If this data is in American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) characters, then the output prints cleanly to the terminal. If not, the output causes garbage data to print to the screen. For reading non-ASCII binary data from a file, it is more useful to employ PowerShell’s underlying .NET framework by calling the following function:
[System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes.



To read the ASCII content of a file, use the following syntax:
Get-Content -Path "C:\path\to\file"



Notably, since it is common in some Windows malware to hide data, such as executable scripts, inside Alternate Data Streams (ADS), the Get-Content cmdlet is used to read those streams with the syntax:
Get-Content -Path "C:\path\to\file" -Stream MaliciousStreamName



The names of the alternative streams are not intuitive. They need to be identified by printing the properties of file items to find anomalous data streams.


Get-Process


This cmdlet is used to retrieve a list of all running process objects. Its output is similar to the output of the tasklist command in the Windows command line. The alias for this cmdlet is gps.
Get-Process

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04bd0a9b-b706-4c72-8a81-7b865410b845)


To expand all the properties each process object contains, pipe the output of a single object, such as the explorer process, into a formatted list (described later in this lesson):
Get-Process -ProcessName "explorer" | Format-List *

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d926d78-0f32-42af-9a61-16d2756bdd82)


Get-CimInstance 


This cmdlet is the updated version of the deprecated cmdlet Get-WMIObject and returns objects queried from a Common Information Model (CIM) server on the device. 


This cmdlet is used for the following purposes: 
Find installed software by querying for members of the Win32_Product class. Other methods of finding installed software include enumerating children of the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall registry key and folders in the Program Files and Program Files (x86) directories.
List running processes by querying for members of the Win32_Process class.
Retrieve metadata for a system by returning the values of the Win32_ComputerSytem class. The properties of this object include model, manufacturer, name, hostname, domain, and administrator password status. 

The syntax for this command is:
Get-CimInstance -ClassName <Win32_Class>

Or
Get-CimInstance -Query "<>" was braking my notes images below is correct
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33a87079-6aa5-4932-9d05-b281637e9543)

Or 
Get-CimInstance -ClassName <win32_class> -Filter @{"property"=VALUE} -Property Name



Get-Service


This cmdlet returns a list of object details for all services installed on the local machine. This includes not only running services but also stopped and suspended services. 
Get-Service


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b93553d0-c20a-42e1-b488-a3661ff687e6)


As with the process list, to expand the properties of a single service object, pipe one specified by name to a formatted table:
Get-Service -DisplayName "DNS Client" | Format-List *

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a38dfcc-34f8-4a40-a242-484d8cfc42f4)

Get-NetTCPConnection


This cmdlet finds and returns all active TCP connection objects. Each object includes properties such as local and remote address, local and remote port, and the connections' state. This cmdlet is useful for determining which ports are opened and comparing that list to the expected network state. This is a useful technique for identifying suspicious processes which are listening or connecting out to malicious addresses.
Get-NetTCPConnection

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce2e919b-3785-4b78-8158-62628b435f55)

To see which properties each NetTCPConnection object contains, run the following command:
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 139 | Format-List *

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46bc9265-f192-438d-bb11-b3ebc8d6af21)

As seen in Figure 11.1-15, if a particular connection is suspicious, details such as CreationTime and OwningProcess are useful in further investigation of the host activity related to the network activity that raised a red flag.


Get-ScheduledTask


This cmdlet is used to retrieve a list of all scheduled tasks in the system. These are often a vector for adversary persistence or may be disabled by adversaries when the task runs scripts or programs to search for malicious activity. 
Get-ScheduledTask 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c90289c-3709-45eb-a8e9-6777ca38dec8)

Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName Proxy | Format-List *

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e518991-0346-467e-8c76-3454b53137b1)

In this data structure, the Triggers and Actions properties are PowerShell objects with more detail about which action is executed and when. During investigations in which scheduled tasks are Indicators of Compromise (IOC), expanding and scrutinizing these structures is warranted.

---------------------------------

PowerShell Data Manipulation Cmdlets
After retrieving an initial set of objects and output from a cmdlet, additional processing and formatting are often required to limit the results to the data and presentation necessary for human parsing for further analysis. The following cmdlets are used for these purposes.

﻿

Select-Object
﻿

This cmdlet is useful for selecting a subset of a cmdlet's output. This can be either a subset of the objects themselves or a subset of the properties of all objects piped to this cmdlet.

﻿

This cmdlet is called with the select alias. 

﻿

The syntax for employing this cmdlet follows the format:

Cmdlet | Select-Object PropertyName1, PropertyName2
﻿

To select the Name, Process ID, and Description of all active processes, the syntax is as follows:

Get-Process | Select-Object Name, ID, Description


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8edcc14f-9bda-4e98-b8d3-3460de6cb0bd)



Another powerful function of Select-Object is to expand PowerShell objects that are the values of a parent object's properties. For example, all Dynamic-Linked Libraries (DLL) loaded by an active process are listed in a collection object, which is stored in the process object property Modules. By using the -ExpandProperty parameter with Select-Object, it is possible to view those loaded libraries. 
Get-Process | Where-Object Name -eq explorer | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Modules


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a0463b7-5bd5-4661-b93a-44b57c1748ed)


Where-Object


This cmdlet is used to select a subset of objects by applying a condition or filter to one or more of an object's properties. A user applies either a straightforward conditional comparison or a more complex FilterString script block with containment, matching, or equality operators.


Containment Operators


These operators are used to filter for objects in a collection that do or do not contain a specific property or a specific value for a property. 
-contains: Filters a collection containing a property value.
-notcontains: Filters a collection that does not contain a property value.
-in: Value is in a collection; returns property value if a match is found.
-notin: Value is not in a collection; null/$false if there is no property value.

Matching Operators


These operators are similar to containment operators, but specifically for strings.
-like: String matches a wildcard pattern (e.g., "foofoo" -like "*foo*" is True; "foofoo" -like "foo" is False). 
-notlike: String does not match a wildcard pattern.
-match: String matches regular expression pattern (e.g., "foofoo" -match "foo" is True). 
-notmatch: String does not match regular expression pattern.

Equality Operators


These operators are most ideal for numerical values, but equality may be assessed between any two objects of the same type.
-eq: Value equal to the specified value.
-ne: Value not equal to the specified value.
-gt: Value greater than the specified value.
-ge: Value greater than or equal to the specified value.
-lt: Value less than the specified value.
-le: Value less than or equal to the specified value.

FilterScript Format


Any of the above operators may be combined in more complex statements in a FilterScript block utilizing the following syntax:
{($_.property1 -operator value1) AND (($_.property2 -operator value2) OR ($_.property3 -operator value3))}



An example statement that filters all active processes with host in the process name and consuming less than 5 Central Processing Unit (CPU) units and more than 0.01 CPU units, reads as follows:
Get-Process | Where-Object {($_.ProcessName -like "*host*") -and ($_.CPU -lt 5) -and ($_.CPU -gt 0.01)}

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1f9463b-7953-48ec-a0a6-5030cfa40dea)


Select-String


This cmdlet is used to find string patterns in data. The use cases include finding sensitive data in text files, parsing out suspicious entries in Windows logs, or identifying files with malicious IOCs in file listings. 


The syntax of this cmdlet when used in a standalone fashion to parse a file is:
Select-String -Path "C:\path\to\file" -Pattern "pattern"



When data is piped to the cmdlet, the syntax takes the following format:
<Data-Object> | Select-String -Pattern "pattern" 



Or when the message to be parsed is in a property of the object, the syntax is as follows:
<Data-Object> | Select-String -InputObject ($_.Property) -Pattern "pattern"



Format-List


By default, PowerShell displays the output of a command as a shortened table of object data. Format-List is an alternative to the default that displays selected properties of the output objects in a list where the properties are each printed on their own line. The alias for this cmdlet is fl. If a user wants to display all properties of an object rather than individually naming a subset, the wildcard character * is used to indicate all properties. 


The syntax for displaying data with this cmdlet uses the following format:
<Data> | Format-List -Property Property1, Property2



An example of formatting the properties of the explorer process in a list looks like the following:
Get-Process | Where-Object -Property Name -match "explorer" | Format-List Name, Description, Path, ID


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30e1acbc-b905-4506-a3a8-2ee9b62e7947)


Format-Table


Alternatively, the table format may be maintained, but if the properties displayed need to be changed, Format-Table is employed with similar syntax and parameters. Its alias is ft.


This cmdlet may also take the parameter -Autosize to minimize truncation of the columns or -Wrap to wrap off-screen columns to a new line, though the latter option may leave data garbled on screen. 


The syntax for this cmdlet uses the following format:
<data> | Format-Table -Property Property1, Property2



An example of formatting the properties of the explorer process in a table looks like the following:
Get-Process | Where-Object -Property Name -match "explorer" | Format-Table Name, Description, Path, ID


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af475ab3-ad61-4895-8c5d-35abb0c9da6c)

Sort-Object


This cmdlet is used to sort a collection of objects based on a particular property's value. This may be useful for sorting events by most recent, files by size, or processes by memory usage. 


The important parameters for this cmdlet are -Property, -Ascending, -Descending, and -Unique.


An example of sorting processes by memory usage looks like the following:
Get-Process | Sort-Object -Property WS -Descending

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48abd5c2-1e2f-43cc-9468-d5221fa5fda7)

Foreach-Object


When performing in-line processing of each object in a collection, the Foreach-Object cmdlet is used to iterate over each object and perform the transformation on it. The alias for this cmdlet is foreach when data is piped to it. However, when used at the beginning of a PowerShell statement, foreach is instead a keyword initializing a loop. Functionally, both methods of iteration achieve the same results when acting on the same object. The distinguishing design consideration is that the Foreach-Object cmdlet expects data to be streamed to it over a pipeline, which maximizes memory conservation at the cost of performance, while the foreach statement loads an entire collection of objects into memory prior to an operation, which maximizes performance at the cost of higher memory usage.


Like functions constructed to handle a series of data objects from a pipeline, Foreach-Object is designed to perform beginning and ending operations around the processing of a collection if the user desires. A script block supplied to the cmdlet without a label is executed on every object, but if a distinction is necessary, separate script blocks may be designated with the -Begin, -Process, and -End parameters.


When data is streamed to the cmdlet, the syntax is as follows:
<Data-Object> | Foreach-Object -Begin {commands} -Process {command1; command2} -End {commands}



When the foreach keyword is used to initiate a PowerShell loop, the syntax is as follows:
Foreach ($object in $collection) {
	Example-Cmdlet -Input $object
}



As an example, to write a subset of events from a previous command to a particular file, the following command is executed:
$events | ForEach-Object -Begin {Get-Date} -Process {Out-File -FilePath Events.txt -Append -InputObject $_.Message} -End {Get-Date}

---------------------------------

PowerShell Input and Output Cmdlets
Invoke-Command
﻿

To supply PowerShell commands for a remote computer to run, the Invoke-Command cmdlet is used for input. Executing this cmdlet successfully requires remote PowerShell administration to be enabled on the target device. 

﻿

The syntax for this cmdlet is as follows:

Invoke-Command -ComputerName TEST001 -Credential Domain\User -ScriptBlock {Command1; Command2}
﻿

If an active PowerShell session was previously established with the New-PSSession cmdlet, then commands may be run through that session with the syntax:

Invoke-Command -Session $sessionName -ScriptBlock {Command1; Command2}
﻿

Write-Output
﻿

This cmdlet is used to print text to the terminal. It is useful for returning feedback to the person executing a script or to provide a prompt when input is required during runtime. 

Write-Output "The time and date is $(Get-Date)"

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0de21c18-7ad8-49a3-85ac-48eadcaaadf5)

Out-File


This cmdlet is used to print the results of a cmdlet or a series of operations to a file on disk. The syntax for this output is as follows:
<Data> | Out-File -Path "C:\path\to\out\file" -Append

----------------------------------

PowerShell Common Cmdlet Parameters
The following list of common parameters is set in many PowerShell cmdlets.

﻿

ErrorAction
﻿

This parameter defines the action taken in the event of an error during execution. The most common use case for setting this parameter is to handle denied access errors, such as when the current PowerShell process does not have permission to access a particular file or directory during a survey script. Setting this parameter reduces the on-screen noise caused by the errors when set with its most common value SilentlyContinue. The ErrorAction parameter is set for any cmdlet.

﻿

This parameter is set with one of the following values.

Stop: Ceases all operations, and the error message is displayed.

Continue: Continues to operate, but verbose error messages are displayed to standard output.

SilentlyContinue: Continues to operate, and no error messages are displayed. An error message is added to PowerShell's $Error variable and may be retrieved later.

Ignore: Identical to SilentlyContinue, but no error messages are recorded, even silently.

Inquire: Pauses in operating, displaying an error message, and prompting the user for permission to continue.

The default behavior for any cmdlet in which this parameter is not manually set is defined by the ErrorActionPreference value. On the win-hunt Virtual Machine (VM), that value is Continue.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1dd8a2c7-f8d2-46a4-8c10-d97fbb0385aa)

Force


In some cmdlets, an operation may be executed that cannot be undone, such as the overwriting or deletion of a file object, or restarting a service. In such cases, the normal operation of the cmdlet is to deny or prompt the user for execution. When a user understands the risks of the operation and desires for it to continue regardless, the -Force parameter switch is appended to the cmdlet command line to bypass any confirmation text and proceed to execution.

----------------------------------------

The PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment
The PowerShell ISE is the editor installed by default in Windows OSs for creating and editing PowerShell scripts. 

﻿

Interface of the ISE
﻿

Toolbar

The toolbar at the top of the ISE window beneath the File menu contains buttons for many quick operations that are used over the course of script development. These include file management buttons such as New, Open, and Save; editing buttons such as Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo, and Redo; and execution buttons such as Run Script, Run Selection, and Stop Operation. Most buttons also have a corresponding keyboard shortcut, which is viewed by hovering the mouse over the button representing the action. For example, hovering over Run Selection shows that the keyboard shortcut for that operation is F8.

In this pane, the body of the script is entered, then saved using the Save button on the toolbar.


Script Tab


When multiple scripts are open simultaneously, the different documents may be navigated through the Script tab.

Console Pane


The Console pane of the ISE is used for running ad-hoc commands or for triggering the execution of a script for testing purposes. This pane follows all the rules of a normal PowerShell session, so it cannot be assumed that the console automatically begins in the same working directory as the script in production.

Key Features of the ISE


Automatic Completion


As code is being entered in the ISE, the editor offers potential completions of known cmdlets for the user to select from a drop-down menu below the cursor. If a user selects Enter while a menu item is selected, the text automatically completes and editing may resume from the end of the text.

Selective Execution


If the functionality for an individual selection of code needs to be tested, a user may run only those commands in the provided console window by selecting the code and F8.

Context-Sensitive Help


In the ISE, the help information for a particular cmdlet or language feature may be brought up by selecting F1 when that element is highlighted. The ISE understands that the context for the requested help is the selected element. 


A corresponding Get-Help <element> -ShowWindow command executes on the user’s behalf in the console window.

Create a Custom PowerShell Script


Using the knowledge gained from the review of PowerShell fundamentals, create a script in the PowerShell ISE that fulfills the intent of a basic situational awareness script that is run by a security team member auditing a Windows device that is either known to be compromised or suspected to be compromised. The script needs to retrieve and cleanly display the following information:

All running processes

All active services

All scheduled jobs and tasks

All active network connections

All installed software

Directory listings of sensitive locations such as the temporary folder, user download folders, and program files

Contents of registry keys commonly used for persistence or compromise

Workflow
﻿

1. Log in to the win-hunt VM using the following credentials:

Username: trainee
Password: CyberTraining1!
﻿

2. Open the PowerShell ISE.

﻿

3. Construct a custom script that fulfills the objectives listed above. Refer to Task 4, Powershell Manipulation Cmdlets, for constructing the script. Use the following PowerShell commands: 

Get-Process
Get-Service
Get-ScheduledTask
Get-NetTCPConnection
Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_Product
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Users\*\Downloads
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Users\AppData\Local\Temp
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\ProgramFiles
Get-Item
  
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ RunServices
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ RunServicesOnce
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ RunOnce\Setup
4. Save and run the script.
